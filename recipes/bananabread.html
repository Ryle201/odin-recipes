        <h2>Description</h2>
        <P> Banana Bread is a moist, sweet, cake-like quick bread; however there are some banana bread recipes that are traditional-style raised breads. This recipe will blow your socks off and is easy too.</P>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 very ripe bananas</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup shortening</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease 2 - 9x5 inch loaf pans. In a medium bowl, mash bananas and stir in the eggs until well blended. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In large bowl, beat shortening and gradually add sugar. Stir in vanilla and banana mixture. Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt; blend into batter. Add walnuts if desired. Divide between the prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.</li>
            
        </ol>
